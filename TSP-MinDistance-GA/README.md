# Traveling Salesman Problem Visualizer Using Genetic Algorithm

Welcome to Traveling Salesman Problem Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by Genetic Algorithms, and I wanted to visualize it in action to solve one of the interesting problems - The Traveling Salesman Problem. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome):  https://jitendrabhamare.github.io/p5js_sketch/TSP-MinDistance-GA/
